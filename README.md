Further analysis was done to determine the decrease in profit of bikes sales in Germany after 2019Q1. Following shows that a few provinces, namely Bavaria, Hesse, and Saarland, shows a huge decrease in profit. Following with a short research, it has been found that there has been a surge in owning e-bikes in Germany. In 2021, e-bikes' market share in Germany stands at 43%. As Adventure Works is only selling bikes without electric assistance, a dip in profit is seen starting 2019Q1. In 2021 also, the ownership of bikes without electric assistance has seen an overall decrease. (Source: https://www.ebike24.com/blog/even-delivery-bottlenecks-cannot-slow-down-ebike-boom-in-2021)
